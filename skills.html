    <!--<img src ="finger.jpeg" class = "image1" alt = "my image">>
    
    <p class = "speech"> This makes each image have the same style.
      How do I style each image differently? I tried to put each image in a different div class,
       so that I could style them differently, but it didn't work.
       I also understand, that I could style each image in the html tag, like this:</p>

    <p>about paragraph</p> -->
